# MD_Analysis_Porphyrin
Analysis of porphyrin molecular dynamics using XTB in CP2K. From .xyz trajectories, bond lengths, angles, dihedrals, and ring distortions (via NSD) were calculated. Correlations between geometry, spin moments, and charge reveal how structural changes control porphyrin electronic behavior. 


# MD_Analysis_Porphyrin

This repository contains analysis scripts and data from **molecular dynamics simulations of porphyrin systems**.  
The simulations were carried out with **XTB within CP2K**, and the resulting `.xyz` trajectory files were analyzed to extract structural and electronic properties.

## üìå Overview

The project focuses on understanding how **geometric distortions of the porphyrin ring** influence its **electronic properties**.  
By combining molecular dynamics with post-simulation analysis, we investigate correlations between:

- Bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedrals  
- Porphyrin ring distortions (via **Normal Coordinate Structural Decomposition**, NSD)  
- Spin moments and charge distributions
