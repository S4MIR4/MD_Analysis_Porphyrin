# MD_Analysis_Porphyrin
Analysis of porphyrin molecular dynamics using XTB in CP2K. From .xyz trajectories, bond lengths, angles, dihedrals, and ring distortions (via NSD) were calculated. Correlations between geometry, spin moments, and charge reveal how structural changes control porphyrin electronic behavior.
